      <h2>Front-End Developer & Webflow Specialist</h2>
      <p  class="intro">I am a Falmouth-based web developer,
        specialising in Webflow and Front-End Development. I'm also a musician
        and a graduate of the University of Exeter, where I completed a bachelor's
        degree in environmental science. My hobbies include playing guitar,
        writing music, surfing, and spending time outdoors with friends and family.</p>

        <h3>Web Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I began teaching myself web design in Figma and development in Webflow to become a digital designer and freelancer.
        Along the way I decided to try coding and discovered that it is really fun! While I still love visual design tools like Figma and Webflow,
        I have found coding more challenging and satisfying. So far I have learned how to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and GitHub, but I am
        continuing to learn more and more everyday!</p>

        <h3>Music & Audio</h3>
        <p>Music has always been my biggest passion, and I have been playing guitar since I was 11 years old. At age 19 I began teaching
        myself electronic music production in Ableton Live, and have since moved onto Logic Pro for guitar-based music. I currently play
        guitar in a Falmouth-based indie band.</p>
